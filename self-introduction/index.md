Hello, everyone! My name is Aleksei, and I am going to introduce myself as an aspiring frontend developer.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. 
I remember my sleepless nights that I spent on my Python homework assignments because I was so curious to finish writing my programs that I couldn't sleep. Back then, I realized that I like programming.

Over the past two years, I have been working with a chatbot development platform where you can include JavaScript scripts. So I learned JavaScript basics to munipulate data during the dialog, send HTTP requests to CRM systems or Google Sheets, and operate with date and time.

In this environment of the platform, there is only synchronous JS of ES5 version. However, I would like to level up as a programmer, so I started to learn web development

When I found Rolling Scopes School, I decided to try myself in frontend development, and I have liked it. I have learned HTML, CSS, ES6, Browser API, NodeJS, Asynchronous JS and some basics of OOP. It has been a really intense learning and I liked it.

In my Virtual Keyboard assignment, I have tried first time to split my code into separate modules which interact with each other. I came up with the following structure: there is one main module that takes input from the physical keyboard and from another module for virtual keyboard keys. Then, it communicates an output task to a third module that represents the text-area HTML element. This approach helped me to keep my code clean and organized.

After that, I learned about the MVC pattern, which I am currently applying in my Minesweeper app. It was quite hard to determine the necessary modules, identify the methods they need to provide, establish their API connections. This experience have boosted my coding skills and improved my understanding of modular approach.

So, I'm really interested in frontend development and want to continue expanding my knowledge in JavaScript development. I plan to continue learning at the RSSchool and land a job this year because I am in desperate need of a joyful, challenging, well-paid job.

Thank you for watching. I hope you, my future mentor, is watching this video right noe, so see you soon and all the best!
