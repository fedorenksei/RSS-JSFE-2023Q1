Hello, everyone! My name is Aleksei, and I am going to introduce myself as an aspiring frontend developer.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. 
I remember my sleepless nights that I spent on my Python homework assignments because I simply couldn't stop! I was so driven to finish writing my programs so that I couldn't sleep. It was during those moments that I realized my love for programming.

After university, I landed a job in chatbot development. Over the past two years, I have been working with a chatbot development platform that allows the inclusion of JavaScript scripts. So I learned JavaScript to do tasks like handle data during conversations, send HTTP requests to CRM systems or Google Sheets, and perform various tasks related to dates and times.

In this environment, only synchronous JS is available, and only the ES5 version is used. Also, there were no code quality requirements in my previous jobs. However, I have a strong desire to advance as a programmer, so I started to learn web development

When I found Rolling Scopes School, I decided to try myself in frontend development, and now I have learned HTML, CSS, ES6, Browser API, OOP, Asynchronous JS, and NodeJS. It has been an intense and exciting learning experience! I have really enjoyed it.

In my Virtual Keyboard assignment, I first tried to split my code into modules. I came up with the following structure: there is one main module that takes input from the physical keyboard and from another module for virtual keyboard keys. Then, it communicates a task to a third module that represents the text-area HTML element. This approach helped me to keep my code clean and organised.

After that, I learned about the MVC pattern, which I am currently implementing in my Minesweeper app. I have spent around a week thinking about the app structure, determining the necessary modules, establishing their API connections, identifying the methods they needed to provide. Also it was hard to figure out how to distribute functionality between the modules, how to avoid redundant operations with DOM. This experience have boosted my coding skills and deepened my understanding of modular approach.

So, I want to continue expanding my knowledge in JavaScript development. I plan to continue learning at the RSSchool and land a job this year because I am in desperate need of a joyful, challenging, well-paid job, which I believe a frontend developer role can provide. I haven't yet decided which framework I will chooseâ€”React or Angular. Maybe React, but I am still unsure.

Thank you for watching, and all the best!
